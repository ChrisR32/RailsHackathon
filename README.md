The wallet is an application that allows users to easily manage and organise their expenses through to do lists and completed tasks. Users will be able to create checklists for expenses, add reoccurring bills, view details of upcoming or paid bills, and view specific dates of pay periods. Users can also enjoy the added convenience of the “upload bills” feature which adds PDF files to their Wallet. Lastly, users can see how much money remains after all expenses are payed.
